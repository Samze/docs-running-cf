 UnkillableContainers                              | Total number of containers that could not be killed/cleaned up on a Diego Cell. If this is non-zero, that cell MUST be rebooted before the next BOSH deploy. Typically this is a result of apps losing connection to NFS when using volume services. Diego cell logs can be searched for `failed-deleting-container` to find App IDs responsible.
